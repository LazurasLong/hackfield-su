# hackfield -su
"hackfield -su": an open-world cyberpunk puzzle adventure.

Based on my Ludum Dare 27 submission from 2013.

Used 3rd party content: Phaser 3.11 (subject to change)

# How to install

Clone this repo.

Run `python3 -m http.server` or `php -S localhost:8000` (on Unix based systems; idk how it happens on Windows) to run a very simply HTTP server.

Visit `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`.

Or just open `index.html` though it [isn't recommended anymore.](http://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started)

## ESLint

Just follow the original ESLint install instructions, really - and then, use my .eslintrc.json.

Nothing special I just thought some may find it useful.

I won't publish a package.json, though, I stay out of npm hell as much as possible. ESLint is exceptional because I want my code to be nice but that's all.
